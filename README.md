**canadaopendata** is a library for working with datasets and other resources in the **Canada Open Data** repository.

Canada has an Open Data initiative where federal and related agencies publish data to an **Open Data Inventory**
This library makes it easy to find and use these datasets in you data projects, whether for analytics, data products or for data science projects.

Before using this library you might first want to visit the [Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data).
There you will find tools for searching for datasets, and each dataset will have a home page that describes the data, and has links to download the data.
That might be all you need. 

However this library adds a programmatic way of working with the Open Datasets, for more technical persons such as Data scientists or analysts.
Often, an analyst will use Jupyter notebook to explore and process data, and so this library is built for programmatic access to the canada open datasets.
